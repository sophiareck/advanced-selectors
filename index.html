      <h1>What is Purim?</h1>
      <h2>It was my favorite Jewish holiday last Friday, and
        I think y'all should know about it.</h2>

            <h2>Here's the actual story from the Torah, summarized:</h2>
        <p>Purim, which literally means “lots” and is sometimes known as
          the Feast of Lots, is the Jewish holiday in which Jews commemorate
          being saved from persecution in the ancient Persian Empire.
          According to the Book of Esther in the Torah, the Jewish people
          of the city of Shushan were threatened by the villain Haman, a prime
          minister who convinces the King Ahasuerus to kill all the Jews
          (because the Jewish Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman). Haman
          casts lots (hence the name of the holiday) to determine the date he
          would carry out his plan: the 13th of Adar. In the end, the Jews
          are saved by the heroic Queen Esther, Mordecai’s niece
          (and adopted daughter), who married Ahasuerus
          (after he banished his first, rebellious wife Vashti).
           When Ahasuerus discovers that his wife Esther is Jewish,
           he decides to reverse Haman’s decree, and instead of the Jews
           being killed, Haman, his sons, and other enemies are killed instead.</p>
